# Apple Stock Price Analysis on Anaconda Jupyter Notebooks

The objective of the project was to analyze the stock price data for Apple and identify any patterns or trends that could be useful for making investment decisions. To do this, the project utilized various tools and techniques in Python, including Pandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy.

Some of the key aspects of the project include: 
* Defining the length of the window and the aggregator to apply to the data.
* Using nbagg functionality in Matplotlib to zoom and pan the data.
* Performing various built-in aggregate calculations and defining custom functions to apply to the DataFrame.
* Working with multiple columns in a DataFrame simultaneously to gain a holistic view of the data.
* Plotting the rolling mean for different window types and lengths to see how the data changes over time.
* Using tight.layout to expand the plotting area and fill in excess white space to enhance the visualization of the data.

Here are some of the key methods used in the project:

* Data cleaning: The data was obtained from Kaggle and required some cleaning before it could be analyzed. This involved removing any null values, converting data types as necessary, and ensuring that the data was sorted chronologically.
* Rolling window calculations: One of the main techniques used in the project was rolling window calculations. This involved creating a rolling average or other aggregate function based on a specified window size. This allowed for the identification of trends and patterns in the data over time.
* Visualization: Matplotlib was used to create visualizations of the data. These visualizations helped to identify trends and patterns in the data and communicate the findings.

Overall, the project was helpful in identifying several key trends and patterns in the Apple stock price data. This included a general upward trend over time, as well as some seasonal fluctuations and short-term trends that could be useful for making investment decisions. The project helped me develop a deeper understanding of time series analysis and how to use different functions and tools in Pandas and Matplotlib to analyze financial data.
